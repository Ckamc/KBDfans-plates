# KBDfans plate files

The following files were modified from the original STEP files found on KBDfans website

The files, besides being converted to DXF also have things such as the countersunk(s) that can be found in the original STEP.
An option for some of the files is the inclusion or stand-offs. Some do not have stand-offs so keep that in mind.

You may also need to check with the CNC/Lazercut provider to see if the material you are using will work with the file, or you may need to make adjustments.
These files are not a guarantee that they will work without modification. You are accepting the risks involved, and these files are intended for personal use only. Not intended for commercial use.
